                        Hello, my name is Preston Ong. I was born and raised in a small town of Malacca City, Malaysia.
                        Since childhood, I have grown a passion in technology and computers. For that reason, I decided to move to California to pursue a dream
                        of becoming the next Steve Jobs. I am very thankful for my parents for supporting and giving me this opportunity. <br>
                        I recently graduated from UC Davis, with a major in Computer Science and a minor in economics.
                        I want to become a software engineer with the goal of making technology more intuitive and user-friendly for people regardless of their backgrounds. <br>
                        My Area of Interests are: Machine Learning, NLP, iOS/Web Developer and Blockchain. <br>
                        If you would like to get to know me better, please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn. <br>
                    </p>
